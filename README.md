# InSpec GCP Deep Dive Profile 

This InSpec profile contains four example InSpec GCP testing scenarios. These were originally discussed in a blog post that will be linked here when available.
 
The included tests cover the following scenarios:
* Testing that a single GCP zone is available for use
* Checking all GCP zones are available for use
* Ensuring no firewall rules allow SSH/HTTP
* Checking all compute instances to ensure none have a particular label
